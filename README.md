# CS245-Project01
This function will read a CSV file of Movies with their cast and Actors. I will scan the file using a Scanner method and create an Actor object for each character 
that is found. Once I have read the file, I will sort my actor objects alphabetically by their actor name. In order to search for each actor, I will use binary
search.
